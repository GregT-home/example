# Example
A bench project to demonstrate and practice with various Ruby constructs.

The program supports a variety of options and arguments.  The combination of options and arguments may differ depending on what construct demonstration is being requested.

The best way to see what is available is to invoke the program either with no arguments or with the --help option.

There are two global flags:

| name | def |
| :-----             |:----- |
| --help             | Print current Usage message |
| --debug *\<level>* | set debugging to *\<level>*, default: 1|
